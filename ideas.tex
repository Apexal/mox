  \section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Purpose}
    This document serves as a repository of project ideas (most likely involving computer science) that I personally come up with or become interested in.
    These are projects I've thought of randomly, projects I've been thinking about for years, and everything in between.
    Ideas are listed with detailed descriptions of their theoretical use with limited reference to actual implementation as that can be left to actual projects if started.

  \section{Ideas}
  \paragraph{Ordering}
    Ideas will be ordered realistically in terms of feasibility, scope, and probability of them actually becoming a reality. Ideas deemed (by me) most likely to be attempted are listed first, and ideas least likely to become a reality will are listed last.
